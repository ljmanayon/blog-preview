- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I get to know more about flexbox which I don't understand at first.
- Learned the importance of writing a semantic HTML

### Continued development

- Try more challenges about HMTL and CSS and once I am comfortable, I'll move to JS

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) - This helped me understand everything
